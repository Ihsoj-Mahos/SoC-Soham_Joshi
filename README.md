I was a part of the project CNN-lytical under the mentorship of Akshat Kumar, Vaibhav Raj, AShwin Ramachandran. 

In this repo, I am including : 
1. Programming Assignments
2. Project Selection Assignments

The programming assignments were in the form of notebooks, so can be run using google colab. In addition, the project included watching lectures of CS231n, a course offered by Stanford University

In addition, I have included the project selection assignments that was used a checkpoint. These assignments have been written in LaTeX, and contain the summaries of lectures 2,3 in the CS231n playlist. Moreover, I have included the summary of lecture 4 in case anyone is interested. 

Summarising the programming assignments, this repo contains : 
1. Assignment 1 - Building a single layer neural network that classifies the MNIST dataset from scratch
2. Assignment 2 - Building a neural network using PyTorch for classifying the MNIST dataset
3. Assignment 3 - A CNN for classifying the CIFAR-10 dataset. 

The experience of the SoC has been very useful, and hopefully this repository helps :)
